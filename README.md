The project goal is to recreate the Google Homepage. It does not have to be pixel for pixel, but it should be able to fool the inattentive eye.
Through this project, I have demonstrated basic html markup and css styling skills such as: adding a sticky footer and header, adding and positioning images, place basic input and button elements, and using developer tools in order to get information about a web page.
